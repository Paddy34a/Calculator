            Hi, I'm Paddy qwq and this is my calculator!
            <br>
            <br>
            Now before you continue reading, I just want to say that this is just a small project which I started to work on, and it's still pretty basic. It doesn't serve a real purpose either, as everything that can be done here is more simple with a real calculator. 
            <br>
            Also if you're by any chance wondering as to why most of the text is in English, but the calculation pages are in German, that's because I didn't feel like writing all text in German ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            <br>
            <br>
            But that's enough from me now, if you decided to continue looking through the page I won't hold you back any longer. Just be sure to read through the following notes as they can be quite helpful if you don't know how to use these pages. 
            <br>
            <br>
            At the top of any page you will always find the navigation buttons, as well as the title. 
            If you click on the title it'll always get you back to this page, and if you click on any of the navigation buttons it'll redirect you to the respective calculator page. 
            <br>
            Futhermore you will always be prompted with clear instructions on how to fill in the text fields of any calculator page, incase you don't know what to insert into them.
